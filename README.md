# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/ajcyberdefense/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-/blob/main/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

I first searched the DeviceFileEvent table for any filenames containing the string "tor," which led me to discover that the user biggis1315 had downloaded a Tor installer. This action triggered multiple Tor-related files being copied to the user's desktop, including the creation of a file named "tor-shopping list.txt". These events began on March 5, 2025, at 20:09:12 UTC.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName  == "anthony-windows"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "biggis1315"
| where FileName contains "tor"
| where Timestamp >= datetime(2025-03-05T20:09:12.0310824Z)
| order by Timestamp desc 
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Next, I queried the DeviceProcessEvent table specifically looking for process command lines referencing "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.7.exe". Analysis of these logs indicated that on March 5, 2025, at 3:19 PM, the user biggis1315 executed a portable version of the Tor Browser (version 14.0.7) on a Windows device named "anthony-windows". The executable, located in the user's Downloads folder (**C:\Users\biggis1315\Downloads**), ran with the command "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.7" without additional parameters. The fileâ€™s integrity was verified by a unique SHA-256 hash: a431eeb579236a04283b9f3730aab01ab2ffce21e1411e3959dc650318cf0e13.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "anthony-windows"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.7"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

Subsequently, I reviewed the DeviceProcessEvent table again, this time looking specifically for evidence that the employee actively launched the Tor Browser. Evidence confirmed that the browser was opened at 2025-03-05T20:10:03 UTC, with multiple subsequent instances of firefox.exe (Tor) and tor.exe processes spawned thereafter.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "anthony-windows"
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe", "start-tor-browser.exe", "torbrowser-install.exe", "browser\firefox.exe")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Finally, I searched the DeviceNetworkEvent table for any network activity indicative of Tor browser usage, particularly targeting known Tor ports. Logs showed that on March 5, 2025, at 3:20 PM, a process on the device "anthony-windows" successfully established a network connection. This connection, initiated by biggis1315, involved the Tor Browserâ€™s modified Firefox (firefox.exe) located at C:\Users\biggis1315\Desktop\Tor Browser\Browser\firefox.exe, and connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 9150, Torâ€™s default SOCKS proxy port. This strongly indicated active use of the Tor Browser to anonymize network traffic. 

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "anthony-windows"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName  == "biggis1315"
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9050", "9051", "9150")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileSize, InitiatingProcessFolderPath
| order by Timestamp desc 
```

## Summary

The user "employee" on the "threat-hunt-lab" device initiated and completed the installation of the TOR browser. They proceeded to launch the browser, establish connections within the TOR network, and created various files related to TOR on their desktop, including a file named `tor-shopping-list.txt`. This sequence of activities indicates that the user actively installed, configured, and used the TOR browser, likely for anonymous browsing purposes, with possible documentation in the form of the "shopping list" file.

---

## Response Taken

TOR usage was confirmed on the endpoint `anthony-windows` by the user `biggis1315`. The device was isolated, and the user's direct manager was notified.
